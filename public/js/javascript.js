  "@Pieter looking through your footage. I'd suggest spending a few more sessions in slow getting your brake markers and lines down. Even in 4th session your markers and lines quite inconsistent. \n\nFor T1 I'd suggest starting with a brake marker of the 1st pit wall falling away. Then follow the lines as I mentioned to Henry above. Try and apex late. \n\nT2 see the lines running across the track? Use the 1st set of dotted lines as brake marker and try and keep the corner tight and then follow the exit as mentioned to Henry.\n\nT3 looks like you can use the short circuit turnoff lines as brake marker or even sooner. Then keep the corner tight to the apex throughout to open up the exit to T4\n\nT4 I see you pick up the bike between apexes. Try and take the corner as one. As we discussed earlier changing direction mid corner upsets the bike. You dont have to apex both, try and aim for the 2nd apex to open your exit onto the straight.\n\nT5 start at braking 200m (about where the trees stop before the red and white wall to your left) then take it incrementally further from there. The line through there is anyone's guess but try and keep tight towards the corner exit to make the flip to the kink less severe.",
  "Here's the basics\n\nPreload adjusts how tight your springs are wound inside. More preload means more load needed to start compressing the spring. Basically it is used as your base suspension height adjustment and your impact absorption tool. More preload makes the bike ride higher and feel harder to ride because road input needs to be more severe to compress the spring. Less preload makes the bike sag down more and softer to ride because easier to compress the springs.\n\nDampening. Your suspension has dampeners in them that help the spring return to resting position quicker. Without it the spring would bounce up and down a lot after every impact.\n\nCompression dampening controls the dampening when the spring compresses, like when you hit a speed bump or brake hard. Harder compression dampening makes the suspension resist being compressed more. So lets say under braking your nose dives a lot. Add some compression to make it resist driving.\n\nRebound is exactly the same as compression but in the opposite direction. So when your spring is pushing the wheel back out, rebound dampening resists that movement. So when you accelerate out of corners and the spring compresses mid corner and your rebound isn't set correctly it can allow the spring to oscillate rather than return to rest position and that's what makes the wavy wear patterns on the tyres",

  "_*sigh*_\n\n_!Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. You can‚Äôt stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It‚Äôs been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúCummet.‚Äù You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.!_",

He told me that once an engine is up to temp, it basically doesn't wear, the bit it does is basically negligible. All the wear an engine experiences is in the time from startup to getting up to temp. So if you're gonna be running it hard in that time, it will wear quicker.\n\nAlso not talking about stressing components, just wearing down components, especially your piston to cylinder interface.
